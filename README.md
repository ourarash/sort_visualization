# sort_visualization

This is my take on visualizing sort algorithms with audio. 

To run either open [index.html](index.html) in a browser, or use npm's local server:
```
npm install -g http-server
http-server
```

Then point your browser at http://localhost:8080/



I used [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) platform.

This was inspired by [this](video).
